# [FreeCodeCamp: Coffee-and-Code - March 4 from 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM](https://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/events/237637469/)

This month, we begin a workshop series focusing on Implementing User Stories with React. 
Over the course of this series, you'll learn to implement common web workflows such as:

- Registration Forms
- Login Forms
- Routing
- Navigation
- Etc 

## Getting Started
- download this repository and unzip it into it's own folder.
- inside that folder, you'll need to open the following files with a text editor such as `atom` or `sublime 2` or `notepad`:
  - `index.html`
  - `index.js`
- next, open `index.html` with a web browser such as `chrome` or `firefox`
